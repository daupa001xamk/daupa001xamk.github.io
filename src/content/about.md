# About Me

Hello there! I'm a passionate individual who finds joy in a variety of creative and intellectual pursuits. Music, coding, and reading are my cherished companions in the journey of life.

What comes to hobbies, I have always listened to music. Not only do I indulge in the sounds of all kinds of genres, but I also like to pick up my bass guitar from time to time to play around with.

Coding has been a significant part of my life for few years now. I find immense satisfaction in deciphering complex problems and crafting elegant solutions. While I initially gravitated toward front-end development, I've been gradually immersing myself in the world of back-end development and the art of unit testing. The ever-evolving nature of technology keeps me motivated, and the challenges it brings.

In my free time, I'll be reading something. Reading is my escape into different worlds, a way to spent free time and feel like I have achieved something for the day. Coupled with listening music, it creates the perfect backdrop for moments of relaxation and introspection. Other than reading or listening to music I used to play a lot of Osu!, a rhythm game, but now I play it now and then.

I embrace my introverted nature as a strength. It allows me to delve deep into problems independently, finding creative solutions and taking full responsibility for my work. While I may not always seek external motivation, my internal drive fuels my continuous quest for learning and self-improvement.

So, that's a glimpse into who I amâ€”a music enthusiast, a coding aficionado, a voracious reader, and an introvert who thrives on self-reliance. I look forward to the exciting challenges and opportunities that the future holds, knowing that every problem I encounter is just another chance to grow.
